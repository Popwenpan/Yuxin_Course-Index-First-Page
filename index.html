    <p id="preface">
      In the further future, perhaps our generation has perished, but new human beings have emerged, they can resist strong ultraviolet rays and can survive in places where oxygen is scarce, they are exiled with a new world.

      A new world has been created. In this world, there is the main planet, that is, the earth of the previous generation, and then seven new planets appear. These seven planets surround the main planet, and these seven planets correspond to human beings of the seven deadly sins, which are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. This new generation of human beings will also be exiled to seven different asteroids for these different original sins to atone for their sins.</p>

  </ul>
  <img src="img/1.png"height="900" width="600";> <img src="img/2.png"height="900" width="600";> <img src="img/3.png"height="900" width="700";>
  <ul>
    <li id="inspiration1">Inspiration</li>
    <p id="inspiration">1.<br>The first plan comes from the idea of ​​the future. My idea is relatively inclined to the concept of the end of the world because I like horror movies, games and even paintings. I always get my inspiration from these absurd ideas.

      In this direction, the 3D modelling software Maya is used. Later, I will use it in comparison with the modelling software C4d, and then select a modelling software suitable for me to complete the subsequent creation.
      
      The first plan can see that the earth in the future has undergone a mutation, and many spikes have grown. Maybe this is the earth that has been devastated by the virus. You can also see a very huge unknown planet in the upper right corner. There are seven asteroids around the mutated earth, which correspond to the seven deadly sins, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust, people with different sins will be exiled to different planets, in other words, human beings are actually a virus on the earth because the destruction of human beings has made the earth dilapidated.
      
      If I choose this plan, I will make the seven deadly sins seven asteroids into different shapes, and let them suggest the meaning of the seven deadly sins.
      <br><br>
      2.<br>The second direction is to do my poster design on the Miro platform, which can be defined as a collage style. I can find various suitable materials, then modify the size of the picture, remove the background of the picture, and finally complete the collage.
      Below is a small experiment I made, you can see that the earth is in ruins, surrounded by viruses, and there are even traces of the explosion.

      I added a stitch to the yellow earth to express the helplessness of people repairing the earth, and because of human disrespect for the earth, the planet cannot return to its original state.

      The wound on the earth is a picture with a white background. I can use the function of removing the white background in the PowerPoint to make this picture only leave the required elements, but I am thinking about how to remove the picture with a complex background.
      <br><br>
      3.<br>The theme of the third direction is the same as that of the first direction, and it is also expressing the concept of the end world. The software is office excel. I am trying to use simple graphics and different colours to express the concept of the seven deadly sins.
      Excel can insert a lot of materials. If I choose this direction, I will consider integrating the collage-style into the creation of this direction.

    <li id="inspiration1">Intent</li>
    <p id="inspiration">I currently choose cinema 4d as my poster creation software. I am exploring many functions. At present, I have a general understanding of the material of this software, as well as the functions of lighting. Many functions are still unfamiliar, so it seems that the effect will be relatively rough.

      I watched some tutorials and tried to divide the largest planet, the Earth, into two parts. The Boolean function of this software is used here. The purpose is to use two different objects for cutting to obtain new objects. In addition, I gave the earth some charred-like texture, showing a feeling of desolation and dilapidation.
      
      For the other seven planets of the original sin, I currently give simple materials. In future creation, I should make these seven asteroids into different shapes, not just to express with the sphere.Around these planets I placed some broken stones, I wanted to express a feeling of fragmentation, after all, the earth has broken into seven new small planets.
      
      In addition, I chose a dark starry sky for the background. Just like the suggestion given by my peers, the black background gives a sense of heaviness and matches the style of the whole theme.
      
      Finally, I am also exploring the lighting function of this software. I have not yet mastered it very well, so the lighting makes the background look a bit awkward. I will continue to try it in the further steps.
      <li id="inspiration1">Feedback</li>
      <p id="feedback">
        1. I like the lighting of the second and third images—I think having less stark light gives the background more depth, like show the vastness of space. I feel like there's something missing with the intent in terms of the 7 deadly sins, but maybe that might change once you start exploring the shapes of the other planets. -From my peers
        <br><br>
        2. I think your fifth composition is really interesting, I like the black background but in this one the way the light is casting the planet in dark is very cool and I think makes it more dramatic. I can see your intent but I couldn't really tell it was the Earth, if that's a part that is important to you then maybe leaving a bit of green/blue would help. I think the starry background is a good choice, though maybe something with less stars would make it seem even more isolated! -Olivia P
        <br><br>
        3. up-close and personal, which allows for a deeper connection with the piece
        - Try to create more irregular cracks into the planet to further express the idea of desolation/dilapidation (right now it feels a little too smooth)
        - Something to try: use colour to represent the seven sins (don't necessarily have to use shapes) -Samantha
        <br><br>
        4. I think your fourth and fifth compositions are the strongest in expressing your ideas of fragmentation. The use of black does go well with your theme but I personally feel was done better in the fifth composition with the use of the white light for contrast... because the use of black in the fourth composition is a bit too heavy and the bottom half of the earth gets lost a bit so i would suggest more accents of the white glowing light or the bluish-green stars under the bottom half of the earth to make sure the shape isn't lost. -From my peers
        <br><br>
        5. I think the posters are very strong on their own as standalone visual images, but have you considered using any type or writing to compliment it? there's a good amount of negative space that can potentially be played with otherwise but I think these are strong compositions! -From my peers</p>

        <li id="inspiration1">Intent and reflect</li>
    <p id="inspiration">This is the third revised version. In this poster, I added new elements, such as a candy-type planet on the left, which is like hard candy, but it also has a lot of bumps on its body. , I want to express a concept of mutation, and at the same time, this planet represents the sin of gluttony.

      On the right side of the poster, I added the concept of a space station, and I was considering if it could be defined as the sin of wrath because this space station has a red core that seems to produce nuclear fusion, expressing a mood of anger.
      
      I began to try to use metal characters for text typesetting. Although it can express the three-dimensional effect, the typesetting in three-dimensional software is relatively complicated. Because the effects of different angles need to be considered, it is necessary to constantly debug.</p>

<h2><u>Invisible and Very Busy</u></h2>

<p class="new-class"><strong>Computers are getting invisible.</strong> They shrink and hide. They lurk under the skin and dissolve in the cloud. We observe the process like an eclipse of the sun, partly scared, partly overwhelmed. We divide into camps and fight about advantages and dangers of The Ubiquitous. But whatever side we take — we do acknowledge the significance of the moment.



With the disappearance of the computer, something else is silently becoming invisible as well — the User. Users are disappearing as both phenomena and term, and this development is either unnoticed or accepted as progress — an evolutionary step.



The notion of the Invisible User is pushed by influential user interface designers, specifically by Don Norman a guru of user friendly design and long time advocate of invisible computing. He can be actually called the father of Invisible Computing.



Those who study interaction design read his “Why Interfaces Don’t Work” published in 1990 in which he asked and answered his own question: “The real problem with the interface is that it is an interface”.</p>

<p>What’s to be done? “We need to aid the task, not the interface to the task. The computer of the future should be invisible!”

It took almost two decades, but the future arrived around five years ago, when clicking mouse buttons ceased to be our main input method and touch and multi-touch technologies hinted at our new emancipation from hardware. The cosiness of iProducts, as well as breakthroughs in Augmented Reality (it got mobile), rise of wearables, maturing of all sorts of tracking (motion, face) and the advancement of projection technologies erased the visible border between input and output devices. These developments began to turn our interactions with computers into pre-computer actions or, as interface designers prefer to say, “natural” gestures and movements.



Of course computers are still distinguishable and locatable, but they are no longer something you sit in front of. The forecasts for invisibility are so optimistic that in 2012 Apple allowed to themselves to rephrase Norman’s predictive statement by putting it in the present tense and binding it to a particular piece of consumer electronics:

We believe that technology is at its very best when it is invisible, when you are conscious only of what you are doing, not the device you are doing it with […] iPad is the perfect expression of that idea, it’s just this magical pane of glass that can become anything you want it to be. It’s a more personal experience with technology than people have ever had.</p>



<p class="new-class">In this last sentence, the word “experience” is not an accident, neither is the word “people”.

Invisible computers, or more accurately the illusion of the computerless, is destroyed if we continue to talk about “user interfaces”. This is why Interface Design starts to rename itself to Experience Design — whose primary goal is to make users forget that computers and interfaces exist. With Experience Design there is only you and your emotions to feel, goals to achieve, tasks to complete.

The field is abbreviated as UXD, where X is for eXperience and U is still for the Users. Wikipedia says Don Norman coined the term UX in 1995. However, in 2012 UX designers avoid to use the U-word in papers and conference announcements, in order not to remind themselves about all those clumsy buttons and input devices of the past. Users were for the interfaces. Experiences, they are for the PEOPLE!

In 2008 Don Norman simply ceased to address Users as Users. At an event sponsored by Adaptive Path, a user interface design company, Norman stated “One of the horrible words we use is users. I am on a crusade to get rid of the word ‘users’. I would prefer to call them ‘people.’” After enjoying the effect of his words on the audience he added with a charming smile, “We design for people, we don’t design for users.”

A noble goal in deed, but only when perceived in the narrow context of Interface Design. Here, the use of the term “people” emphasizes the need to follow the user centered in opposition to an implementation centered paradigm. The use of “people” in this context is a good way to remind software developers that the User is a human being and needs to be taken into account in design and validation processes.

But when you read it in a broader context, the denial of the word “user” in favor of “people” becomes dangerous. Being a User is the last reminder that there is, whether visible or not, a computer, a programmed system you use.

In 2011 new media theoretician Lev Manovich also became unhappy about the word “user”. </p>

<p>He writes on his blog “For example, how do we call a person who is interacting with digital media? User? No good.”

Well, I can agree that with all the great things we can do with new media — various modes of initiation and participation, multiple roles we can fill — that it is a pity to narrow it down to “users”, but this is what it is. Bloggers, artists, podcasters and even trolls are still users of systems they didn’t program. So they (we) are all the users.

We need to take care of this word because addressing people and not users hides the existence of two classes of people — developers and users. And if we lose this distinction, users may lose their rights and the opportunity to protect them. These rights are to demand better software, the ability “to choose none of the above”, to delete your files, to get your files back, to fail epically and, back to the fundamental one, to see the computer.

In other words: the Invisible User is more of an issue than an Invisible Computer.

What can be done to protect the term, the notion and the existence of the Users? What counter arguments can I find to stop Norman’s crusade and dispel Manovich’s skepticism? What do we know about a user, apart from the opinion that it is “no good” to be one?



We know that it was not always like this. Before Real Users (those who pay money to use the system) became “users”, programmers and hackers proudly used this word to describe themselves. In their view, the user was the best role one could take in relation to their computer.

Furthermore, it is wrong to think that first there were computers and developers and only later users entered the scene. In fact, it was the opposite. At the dawn of personal computer the user was the center of attention.</p>

<p>The user did not develop in parallel with the computer, but prior to it. Think about Vanevar Bush’s “As we May Think” (1945), one of the most influential texts in computer culture. Bush spends more words describing the person who would use the Memex than the Memex itself. He described a scientists of the future, a superman. He, the user of the Memex, not the Memex, itself was heading the article.



20 years later, Douglas Engelbart, inventor of the pioneering personal computer system NLS, as well as hypertext, and the mouse, talked about his research on the augmentation of human intellect as “bootstraping” — meaning that human beings, and their brains and bodies, will evolve along with new technology. This is how French sociologist Thierry Bardini describes this approach in his book about Douglas Engelbart: “Engelbart wasn’t interested in just building the personal computer. He was interested in building the person who could use the computer to manage increasing complexity efficiently.”

And let’s not forget the title of J.C.R. Licklider’s famous text, the one that outlined the principles for APRAs Command and Control research on Real Time System, from which the interactive/personal computer developed — Man-Computer Symbiosis (1960).

When the personal computer was getting ready to enter the market 15 years later, developers thought about who would be model users. At XEROX PARC, Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg introduced the idea of kids, artists, musicians and others as potential users for the new technology. Their paper “Personal Dynamic Media” from 1977 describes important hardware and software principles for the personal computer. But we read this text as revolutionary because it clearly establishes possible users, distinct from system developers, as essential to these dynamic technologies. Another Xerox employee, Tim Mott (aka “The father of user centered design”) brought the idea of a Secretary into the imagination of his colleagues.</p>

<p>This image of the “Lady with the Royal Typewriter” predetermined the designs of XEROX Star, Apple Lisa and and further electronic offices.

So, it’s important to acknowledge that users existed prior to computers, that they were imagined and invented — Users are the figment of the imagination. As a result of their fictive construction, they continued to be re-imagined and re-invented through the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, and the new millennium. But however reasonable, or brave, or futuristic, or primitive these models of users were, there is a constant.

Let me refer to another guru of user centered design, Alan Cooper. In 2007, when the U word was still allowed in interaction design circles, he and his colleagues shared their secret in “About Face, The Essentials of Interaction Design”:

“As an interaction designer, it’s best to imagine that users – especially — beginners — are simultaneously very intelligent and very busy.”

It is very kind advice (and one of the most reasonable books on interface design, btw) and can be translated roughly as “hey, front end developers, don’t assume that your users are more stupid than you, they are just busy.” But it is more than this. What the second part of this quote gets to so importantly is that Users are people who are very busy with something else.

Alan Cooper is not the one who invented this paradigm, and not even Don Norman with his concentration on task rather than the tool. It originated in the 1970’s. Listing the most important computer terms of that time, Ted Nelson mentions so called “user level systems” and states that these “User-level systems, [are] systems set up for people who are not thinking about computers but about the subject or activity the computer is supposed to help them with. Some pages before he claims:
